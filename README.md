# projInference

Analyse and model human inference behavior in a task in which optimality requires exploiting knowledge of stimulus statistics to improve estimation.

Task
----
To run the task git clone the project and follow the instructions given in .../task/README.txt

1. Set your screen parameters (will run on screenNumber = 1, you can change the screen number in taskDotDir.m)

2. Open runTask
	
Run an  10ยบ prior

```matlab
taskDotDir('steeve_exp12_metho_Pstd010_mean225_coh006012024_dir36_t107_073_033perCoh_130217')
```

or a 80ยบ prior

```matlab
taskDotDir('steeve_exp12_metho_Pstd080_mean225_coh006012024_dir36_t106_075_034perCoh_130217')%dropped frames: 0.00 %done
```

note : taskDotDir.m loads the stimulus parameters (each trial's motion direction and coherence and a few stats) stored in a file like (e.g., 10ยบ prior) :

```
steeve_exp12_metho_Pstd010_mean225_coh006012024_dir36_t107_074_033perCoh_controlRndInitPosSymPrior_131224.mat
```

There is one file per prior.

3. When the task is running to enter a response move your mouse to the desired direction, then press 1 on keyboard (make sure mglEditScreenParameters takes "1" as input)
