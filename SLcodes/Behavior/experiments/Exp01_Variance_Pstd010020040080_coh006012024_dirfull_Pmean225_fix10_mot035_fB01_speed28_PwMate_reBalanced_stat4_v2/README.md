We independently manipulated the strength of sensory evidence and priors 
in a motion direction estimation task to test whether subject's 
behavior conformed to a Bayesian model of sensory inference [Girshick 2011, Nature Neuroscience]. 

On each trial 
- a brief (300ms) presentation of a random dot stimulus was presented 
- while subjects fixated a central fixation cross.
- Subjects were instructed to report the direction of motion of the dots by turning an electronic paddle wheel (Griffin PowerMate) 
to move a white line from a random initial orientation to point in the direction of motion that 
they had perceived and then confirmed that report with a button press. 
- Subjects were not given explicit feedback as to whether they were correct or not, instead a green feedback line would
be shown afterwards which pointed in the true direction of motion. 

We dissociated the effects of sensory evidence and priors by independently manipulating the strength of motion by changing the 
percentage of dots moving in the same direction (motion coherence) and the strength (sharpness) of 
the distribution of motion directions over trials within blocks of 202 to 226 trials.

**Prior statistical distribution of motion directions**
- Circular Gaussian (von Mises): VM(theta:225,k)
- k = 0.7 or 2.7 or 8.7 or 33  (about 10, 20 ,40 and 80 deg std)
- four blocks of 221,204,202,226 trials for 10,20,40 and 80 deg std randomly interleaved with a short break in between
